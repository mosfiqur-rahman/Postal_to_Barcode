PROGRAM : postal_bar_code_converter.cpp
PURPOSE : This program will convert any five digit zipcode into its complete barcode. For this reason,
          it will take the integer value of the zipcode as an input, and will show the barcode as an output.
          Here, the program will ask its user  to input a zipcode, the program will convert it into barcode.
          The program will continue to ask its user as long as the user
          inputs integers. If the user inputs anything other than integers[i.e. any character like- 'a', etc],
          then the program will terminate, and end its process. But if the user inputs any decimal number,
          the program will only count the integer part of the input.

To run the program, please open the postal_bar_code_converter.cpp file in a compiler that is able to compile any program, which is written in C++. After that, build and run the program. 

A new window will pop-up. It will show you a few lines about the purpose of the program. Then it will ask you to enter a five digit zipcode. While entering your input, please keep a few thinks in mind-

1) Don't give a negetavie number as an input, because it will show you an error alert, and ask you to enter the zipcode again.
2) Don't give a decimal number as an input, because if you do so, the program will just count the integer part before the decimal point for further calculation.
3) Don't give any input outside integers, because if you give any value other than integers, the program will terminate, and end its process.

Now, if you can avoid all these three mistakes, and give a perfect zipcode as an input, then my program will give you the converted barcode for your zipcode as an output instantly. Moreover, you will be able 
to use as many times as you want without closing or re-build, and running unless you make any input mistake.


At last, thanks for using my program.
Let me know, if you have some more queries or you need more cool programs like this.
